        <p>I'm Emily, my family and friends call me Emma or Em. My biggest passions in life are creativity and technology. I love painting and makeup. I also love setting up computer networks, troubleshooting problems, and messing around with new tech. I play video games, board games, and I go to a lot of concerts. To soothe my soul I hike in nature, do yoga, and HIIT cardio. I value family, I'm grateful to have two of the best sisters a girl could ask for. I have 3 nephews and two nieces who mean the world to me and I am very close with one of my cousins. I was in the Navy for 11.5 years and I'm graduating this semester at Germanna Community College. I want to work for the company I'm interning for currently.</p>

        <p>These are my boys. Donte Panlin on the left and Abathur on the right. They're brothers and named after video game characters. They found me while I was on a walk right after Halloween in 2020. They were kittens wandering the streets of King George, hungry and looking for love.</p>
