        <p>Most of the experience I have coding websites comes from using websites like WordPress, Tumblr, or similar, editting and modifying existing code. I spend a lot of time googling how to do something with html or CSS and copying the code I find and modifying it to my liking.</p>
        <h4>Her Tools:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>W3 Schools</li>
            <li>Notepad++</li>
            <li>GeeksforGeeks</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Her Sites:</h4>
        <p>I had built a website for my Etsy shop but I deleted it when my mental health was suffering. I do still own the domain for it.</p>
        <p><a href="http://patch-workshop.com/">The Patch Workshop</a></p>
        <p>The only website I have up right now is from Web Design I final project.</p>
        <p><a href="https://epatch.github.io/">Potter's Paint Studio</a></p>
        <h4>Her Plans:</h4>
        <p>I want to build a website for my parents to share their bird watching pictures and videos. I just bought them a bird buddy (a bird feeder with a video camera) and I would love to set up a live feed for the family to see. It would be blog style and easy for older people to use and access. I would link bird identification references and they would have the ability to tag the type of bird in the picture they posted.</p>
